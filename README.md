Microservice made during the `Spring Boot y Spring Cloud: arquitectura de microservicios en la nube` course on [TrainingIT](https://www.trainingit.es/).

## What I've learned

- Using RestTemplate to make HTTP calls from one service to another.
- Using interceptors to access a secured service.
- Using an Eureka server to access resources on another microservice.

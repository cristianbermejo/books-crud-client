# books-crud-client

Microservice made during the `Spring Boot y Spring Cloud: arquitectura de microservicios en la nube` course on [TrainingIT](https://www.trainingit.es/).

Notes:
- Switch to the `feature/secured` branch to see the version of this project that's able to connect to a secured service.
- Switch to the `feature/eureka` branch to see the version of this project that uses an Eureka server to access the books-crud microservice.

## What I've learned

- Using RestTemplate to make HTTP calls from one service to another.
